## Working Principal 
The working principle of an android application that takes cyber complaints as inputs
and sends a tracking number as output involves several steps.
Firstly, the user opens the application and navigates to the section where they can input
their complaint. The user must provide all the necessary details related to their
complaint, such as the type of cybercrime, the date and time of the incident, and any
evidence or supporting documents they may have.
Once the user submits their complaint, the application generates a unique tracking
number that the user can use to track the progress of their complaint. The tracking
number is usually a combination of letters and numbers that is unique to each complaint
and is used to identify it throughout the entire process.
The application then forwards the complaint and the tracking number to the appropriate
authorities or organizations responsible for handling cybercrime complaints.
The authorities will then investigate the complaint and take appropriate action to
resolve the issue. Throughout the process, the user can track the progress of their
complaint using the tracking number provided by the application.
In summary, the android application for cyber complaints works by allowing users to
submit their complaints, generating a unique tracking number for each complaint,
forwarding the complaint and tracking number to the relevant authorities, and allowing
users to track the progress of their complaint using the tracking number.
